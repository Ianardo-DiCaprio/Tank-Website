         Restoration of Valentine IXDD WD No. T82527DD</h4>
<p class="restore">
This tank was built by Metropolitan Cammel in 1943 at their Midland 
works, Washwood Heath, Birmingham. It was one of a batch of Valentines 
built under order number TM 6118. This had been placed on 7 October 1941 
and was originally made out for 52x Mk V, 16x Mark IX, 75x Mark VDD 
and 312x Mark IXDD. This order was altered later to show 92x Mark IX, 
127x Mark VDD and 236x Mark IXDD. The order actually states "Special 
Hulls" (rather than DD) which referred to hulls with thinner than normal 
sides (43mm instead of 50 mm) and also a hole bored in the rear plate to 
accommodate the power take-off. The contract price was £5,021 each with a 
number of items being "free issue", for example engine, transmission and 
weapons. The DD equipment was the subject of a separate order 
TMJ294/1025 at £1,193 each. It is understood that hulls for these machines 
were built at both Washwood Heath in Birmingham and Old Park Works in 
Wednesbury. They were fitted with turrets from Stothert and Pitt in Bath, 
supplied as complete assemblies and then moved to a secure compound at 
Washwood Heath for the DD equipment to be fitted in great secrecy.
The tank was delivered to the Army in about the spring of 1943 and its 
service is unknown but when purchased for restoration it had 122 miles 
recorded. It also had signs of a workshop overhaul in that the inside had 
been repainted but without removing major components like the oil tank. 
Seaside type sand was also noted in some of the crevices. It is known that 
the riveted hull Valentine amphibious tanks started to leak at the riveted 
joints after about a hundred miles and so it is probable that the tank was used 
for several practice landings and then returned for a service and a tightening 
of the rivets. It seems it was then stored until disposed of in 1946/7 to G. R. 
Mole Brothers of Clows Top by Kidderminster. This company started to sell 
Military surplus equipment after the First World War and continued in this 
business until it closed down in the 1960's.
In 1947 the tank was sold to Harold Ellard, along with Mark III Valentine 
T121944 with the intention of making them into bulldozers. He paid £450 
each for them with tools and delivery as extras. The Mark III arrived without 
a turret according to verbal information I received in 1984 and at this time 
this hull was complete in all respects apart from the turret and the turret 
drive electrics. It is uncertain if this hull was ever fitted with a turret of the 
correct type prior to disposal. It was professionally restored and is now in 
the Cors Museum in Virginia, USA.<br />
The Mark IXDD came with its turret and part of the contract was that it would be disarmed,
a clause sometimes referred to as the "Smelting condition". The Mark IXDD 's turret was 
removed and cut up with oxy-acetalene and most of the parts left outside. The rear of the
platform was also cut off and this, along with the turret turntable was all thrown outside.
A small portion of the turret side with the traverse gear, the propeller drive and the turret
roof were kept in Mr Ellard's factory in Wednesfield, Wolverhampton with the hull. The engine
covers, were removed and placed outside and the driver's doors, driver's roof plate and the 
right hand radiator door were removed but their fate is unknown. The hinges on the left-hand
radiator door were cut but the door was not removed. The fate of the propeller is unknown 
(but was rumoured to have been kept in store until 1984 when it's location could not be 
ascertained. It probably became a souvenir of an employee of the factory). On 25 December 
1983 Mr. Ellard died and left his property to United Charities, i.e. The Freemason organisation.
They decided to liquidate the donation and the contents of the factory, which had become 
somewhat of a store, was auctioned on 10 July 1984. The Mark IXDD was purchased by myself 
by way of a bank loan, money already in the bank due to an insurance payout for a boat that 
was accidentally burned and a personal loan from Mr Thomas Wardroper, a friend. Restoration 
was initially at Hill Farm, Essington, then at Watt Meadow Farm and since 1994 at Ride Farm, 
Essington. Initially I was able to use engineering facilities at the late Mr Ellard's factory 
but this closed in April 1985. Up to his death I was assisted by my late father in law Frank 
Addison who had been a toolmaker at Ellard's. Facilities have included the use of his lathe
and a further lathe of my own, one of which is configured as a milling machine. I have hand
metal forming machinery, a Bedford crane, 2 sets of oxyacetylene equipment a MMA welder (140 amp) 
and a MIG welder for thinner sections and an air compressor. As well as making parts myself,
some parts have been made by Barnshaw Benders. The rest of the work is completed with hand 
tools. I have no regular workforce but have received help from a number of people, most 
regularly my sons. Work progressed slowly for many years and a proportion of what was made
was subsequently disposed of due to poor quality workmanship. A Valentine Mark I turret was 
obtained from Sennybridge training area and fitted in late 1988. It was removed in 2001. <br /><br /></p>

<p class="restore"><b><u>Present state (August 2004)</u></b> <br /><br />
<b><u>Turret</u><br /><br /></u></b>
Progress was much more rapid once a turret ring and other parts were 
obtained from New Zealand in spring 2001. The original gun mounting, 
turret front, sides, and front half of the roof plate have been combined with a 
rear bustle from a New Zealand Mark V, a turret ring from another N. Z. 
Mark V and a replacement rear roof plate cut from mild steel. Suspended 
from this turret is a replacement turret basket made from mild steel, some 
parts bent by Barnshaw Benders and some by myself. The turret has an 
original 6 pdr Mark WN gun tube that was rebored after the war to approx. 
67-mm for tests. A 75mm breech ring is fitted. This ring appears to have 
been made from a billet of steel intended for a 6 pdr and exhibits some of the 
features of both but is clearly marked 75mm. The remains of the original 
recoil shield are to be repaired. New periscopes and telescopic sights have 
been fitted. I am in the process of making the extended periscopes for use 
with the screen erected.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="restore"><b><u>Hull</u></b><br /><br />
The trackguards have been extended to the original profile. The 4 original 
engine covers have been grit-blasted. A replacement for the missing section 
has been made from mild steel combined with some components recovered 
from Studland Bay. The missing RHS radiator door has been replaced with 
one from a Valentine target from Sennybridge range which has necessitated 
some realignment of the hinges due to this being built to suit 60mm 
sideplates. Drivers roof plate and hatches have been replaced with ones from 
Valentine Mark I T16420 from a range at Pirbright in Surrey. The drivers 
roof plate had to have turret protection angle added in mild steel as this is 
not fitted to the Mark I. The brass identification plate has been replaced with 
a replica cast from an original also recovered from Studland. All of the 
remaining interior fittings of the hull are original.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="restore"><b><u>Engine/transmission.</u></b><br /><br />
The engine and transmission were fully functioning when purchased but 
were removed in 1988 to free a stuck clutch plate. Some pipe work has been 
replaced and the starter motor serviced. The radiators were showing 
considerable corrosion of the header tanks due to galvanic corrosion and 
were removed for repair. The radiator bottom water connecting steel tube 
was very corroded but has been repaired by welding on patches rather than 
being replaced to retain as much authentic material as possible.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="restore"><b><u>DD equipment</u></b><br /><br />
The compass and binnacle equipment has been replaced with components 
recovered from Studland bay. The rear compass mounting will be replaced 
by an identical fitting from a Cavalier tank but the lower mounting bracket 
for this will have to be guesswork. The steering and propeller raising 
equipment has been remade. The re-manufactured frame props are finished, 
as is the tubing for the frame, including the hinges. The frame clamps are 
drilled and located on the frames and some of the canvas attachment strips 
are made. The material for the remainder is to hand. A prototype canvas 
screen has been made to obtain dimensions and to discover the difficulties of 
making the screen in situ rather than completing it and then fitting later. This 
screen has been fitted for the 2004 season and will be replaced with the 
correct one once that is completed The air tubes are fitted and the whole 
system works, raising and lowering but it requires access to an air supply for 
it to function. The bases of the air tubes have been made with a simplified 
system of air dump system. An original propeller was obtained from a diver 
who had recovered it from Studland Bay but this went missing in mysterious 
circumstances in 1992. Another Studland propeller was used as a master for 
a casting in about 1993 but this casting was not fettled until 2002. The 
propeller lifting and steering system is fully functional but the hydraulic 
connections between the driver's controls and the rear duplicates has yet to 
be connected.<br /><br /></p>


<p class="restore"><b><u>Vehicle identity</u></b><br /><br />
The WD number on Valentines is marked on the driver's door and on the brass maker's plate on 
the lhs trackguard, all of which are missing. The individual parts are marked in the factory but 
photographs of construction show the use of paint or chinagraph pencil rather than stamping so 
this detail is lost under subsequent paint. When the engine was removed in 1988 one of the thin 
pieces of ducting around the lhs radiator had the number 1022 hand written on it with china graph 
but this had subsequently disappeared due to surface rusting by 2001. In 2003, several '1022' or 
`22' numbers were found under the paint. At Bovington there is a book listing engine numbers 
fitted to tanks when built but this stops in the T60,000 series so the engine number, although 
visible is no use in identifying the tank's number. When purchased, the tank came with an 
original Valentine IX handbook with the number "82527" hand written at the top of the 
specification page and it also included the original receipt from G. R. Mole Brothers in the 
flyleaf. One of the identity plates recovered from Studland shows the WD number as T82546 and 
the chassis build number as M1041. Other machines built by Metro Cammel show chassis 
numbers starting with either OP or M. An ex-employee told me that the same system was in use 
into the 1970's and relate to the products of the Old Park factory in Wednesbury and the Midland 
factory in Washwood Heath, Birmingham, respectively. It will be noted that the vehicle built 19 
tanks before T82546 at Midland works would have been T82527 which by the same calculation 
would have had M1041 minus 19 equals chassis number M1022. This coincidence with the 
numbers on the vehicle and the handbook is too improbable to consider unless this tank is indeed 
T82527. Attempts have been made to find items that contradict this without success, for example 
the engine of T82527 should be the later 165-horse power version according to the handbook and 
it is. The tank is clearly an early Mark IX due to the Mark V lighting system and was probably 
ordered as a "land" Mark IX originally which accounts for the 4" smoke dischargers mounting on 
the turret. Accordingly, the replica brass maker's plate has been marked as T82527DD/M1022. 
This plate itself has been cast as a copy of a plate recovered from Studland with the detail of the 
original numbers scraped from the sand mould prior to casting. The crude stamping of "DD" 
follows the original pattern. The meaning of "WT" is unknown: it would usually signify that the 
vehicle was fitted with radio (Wireless telegraphy) but all Valentines were so equipped but not all 
surviving Identity Plates have the marking.<br /><br /></p></center>
