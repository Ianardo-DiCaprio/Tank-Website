         Restoration of Valentine IXDD WD No. T82527DD</h4>
<p class="restore"><b><u>Vehicle identity</u></b><br /><br />
The WD number on Valentines is marked on the driver's door and on the brass maker's plate on 
the lhs trackguard, all of which are missing. The individual parts are marked in the factory but 
photographs of construction show the use of paint or chinagraph pencil rather than stamping so 
this detail is lost under subsequent paint. When the engine was removed in 1988 one of the thin 
pieces of ducting around the lhs radiator had the number 1022 hand written on it with china graph 
but this had subsequently disappeared due to surface rusting by 2001. In 2003, several '1022' or 
`22' numbers were found under the paint. At Bovington there is a book listing engine numbers 
fitted to tanks when built but this stops in the T60,000 series so the engine number, although 
visible is no use in identifying the tank's number. When purchased, the tank came with an 
original Valentine IX handbook with the number "82527" hand written at the top of the 
specification page and it also included the original receipt from G. R. Mole Brothers in the 
flyleaf. One of the identity plates recovered from Studland shows the WD number as T82546 and 
the chassis build number as M1041. Other machines built by Metro Cammel show chassis 
numbers starting with either OP or M. An ex-employee told me that the same system was in use 
into the 1970's and relate to the products of the Old Park factory in Wednesbury and the Midland 
factory in Washwood Heath, Birmingham, respectively. It will be noted that the vehicle built 19 
tanks before T82546 at Midland works would have been T82527 which by the same calculation 
would have had M1041 minus 19 equals chassis number M1022. This coincidence with the 
numbers on the vehicle and the handbook is too improbable to consider unless this tank is indeed 
T82527. Attempts have been made to find items that contradict this without success, for example 
the engine of T82527 should be the later 165-horse power version according to the handbook and 
it is. The tank is clearly an early Mark IX due to the Mark V lighting system and was probably 
ordered as a "land" Mark IX originally which accounts for the 4" smoke dischargers mounting on 
the turret. Accordingly, the replica brass maker's plate has been marked as T82527DD/M1022. 
This plate itself has been cast as a copy of a plate recovered from Studland with the detail of the 
original numbers scraped from the sand mould prior to casting. The crude stamping of "DD" 
follows the original pattern. The meaning of "WT" is unknown: it would usually signify that the 
vehicle was fitted with radio (Wireless telegraphy) but all Valentines were so equipped but not all 
surviving Identity Plates have the marking.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="restore"><b><u>Turret</u></b><br /><br />
The exterior parts are largely original to the vehicle with the exception of one half of one hatch 
the right hand triangular filler plate and the rear section of the roof plate, which are cut from mild 
steel. The hatch is copied from an original as the parts list states they are identical. The hinges are 
original to this vehicle except one pair recovered from a Valentine I target from Sennybridge. The 
turret bustle came from a Valentine Mark V from New Zealand but is identical to the remains of 
the original bustle and the parts list state they are identical. The "A" set aerial mounting is the 
original, with a repair to the rhs flange, damaged by oxy-acetalene when the turret was cut. The 
"B" set aerial is an original with copy cage and base bracket. The turret ring came from a 
different Mark V from New Zealand and although similar is not identical to the Mark IX in that 
the turret traverse mechanism is mounted some 3 inches to far in a clockwise direction if the 
turret is viewed from above. Unless this is altered then it will not be possible to fit the electric 
motor to the traverse mechanism. Due to its different position it has been necessary to shorten one 
of the brackets that mount the platform side plates to the turret ring. These mounting plates are 
based on one original found in the hull but are bent from 75x50x6-mm angle iron where the 
original was made from thinner material. The 50-mm leg has been shortened to match the original 
profile. The positioning and proportions of the brackets have been determined by scaling up the 
parts list and comparing them in appearance to illustrations in the Valentine Mark IX stowage
diagrams. The apparently strange "overlapping" appearance of these brackets has been copied. 
The 4" smoke discharger bracket is original to the turret and the stowage for the 4" smoke 
grenades/flare pistol was copied from the fragmentary remains found in the turret upon purchase. 
N.B. The stowage lists and pictures for the IX DD state these are NOT fitted but these fittings are 
original, as is the turret lighting arrangement, listed as being for Mark V's only in the parts list.  
The gun mounting and elevation system is original with some of the lighter components of the 
firing mechanism replaced, based on the parts list. The bullet splash shields are largely original 
except for the left hand one. This has been cut by Oxy acetylene when the turret was cut and had 
then suffered corrosion. It will be replaced with a piece based on the parts list but actually made 
to fit the original parts and the existing bolt holes as the parts list and the remaining parts do not 
entirely agree in shape. The turret platform frame has been made from 75x50x6-mm mild steel 
angle iron bent by Bamshaw Benders. They also plasma cut the 3mm floor plate. The remainder 
of the floor framing is made of second hand channel and the centre fitting for the electrical 
connections came from a Mark I from Sennybridge. The general arrangement and the length of 
the vertical plates came from geometric calculations from the parts list. The metal thicknesses are 
probably excessive compared to the originals and the circular part of the frame should probably 
be 3x1x3/16 inches. The thickness of the plates is the nearest metric equivalent to measurements 
taken on Bovington's Mark I. The ammunition stowage is taken from life-size expansions of the 
parts list. The internal construction, apart from what is shown in the parts list is conjecture. There 
is one lid remaining, found in the hull used to scale the reconstruction and metal thickness of the 
lids. One of the adjusting screws for the commander's seat is original. The loaders seat is largely 
made from a similar part from a Sennybridge Mark I with a new base. Although of similar shape 
and appearance, the seat base should be metal on the Mark IX, not wood as in the Mark I.. Except 
for the stowage above the radio which is repaired original and the bracket for the turret ventilation  
fan, all internal stowage and fittings are taken from the parts list apart from the smoke grenade 
box mentioned. The overhead conduit and turret ventilation fan switch is original. The lights 
follow the original pattern, that is the arrangement usually met in the Mk V only. The sighting 
vane is a replacement bracket and shafts copied from the original. All of the periscope guards are 
original in their original positions with new internals.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="restore"><b><u>Hull</u></b><br /><br />
Original except for drivers doors and roof plate, right hand radiator door and the right hand, rear 
engine cover section. The inner section of the trackguards are original and have been re-extended 
to replace sections cut off, supposedly to enable the vehicle to pass a narrow doorway at Ellardis. 
The width of the guards came from measurement from the same source used for the location of 
most of the airbase brackets and their profiles. The radiator props are new fabrications, copied 
from Bovington's and rusted remains from Sennybridge. The rear platform is made to 
measurements taken from the remains of the original found in 1984 in a very fragile state due to 
rust. The propeller guard sides are original with new brackets and angle irons made from the 
nearest size of metric angle iron. The cross brace at the rear is a new fabrication in the nearest 
metric equivalent angle iron to the fragmentary remains discovered with the platform rear. The 
original was welded to each platform and the top of the propeller cover part of the rear platform 
but this prevents removal of any of the parts. It is proposed not to weld the one on this vehicle but  
to bolt it to the centre section and attach it to each trackguard by blind bolts into welded pads 
allowing subsequent removal of any parts. The rhs front idler bracket was torn from the hull in 
1988 in an accident and has been repaired by Adrian Barrel. Vehicle "temporarily" fitted with one 
from Sennybridge Mark I. LHS bracket strained requires repair. Sign in driver's compartment 
warning of need to switch off batteries is a replacement copied from Bovington's. Brass circuit 
diagram on His hull side is a recovered item from Studland. Note that the driver's light fittings (2 
festoons) are more usually associated with the Mark V according to the parts list but this is the 
original arrangement although the light fittings themselves are replacements.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="restore"><b><u>Engine/transmission</u></b><br /><br />
No major modifications or changes. The fan belts and hoses have been changed and a rusted steel 
drain pipe from the water pump has been replaced with a brass one but apart from that everything 
is as built.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="restore"><b><u>DD equipment
(Mechanism)</u></b><br /><br />
The steering and lifting equipment is all new fabrication, based on the remains of the items in the 
platform rear. Some assistance also obtained from scaling up the parts list. There is one known 
error in that the bracket holding the end bearing on the lifting arm should be mounted on a 'A inch 
thick pad to the vertical plate but the bracket has been made 'A inch too long and is mounted 
directly upon the plate. Most of the fittings, which will be underwater, should be mounted on 
pads with blind bolts from the wet side instead of through bolts as I have done in error. The brass 
bushes and bolts along with the larger fork end on the steering drag link are all original parts. The 
power take off is original with new bearings. The chrome ball requires some building up with 
weld of some pitting and will then be re-chromed. The propeller shaft was bent about 10 degrees 
when received and has been straightened by cold bending with a pipe bender. It is unlikely to be 
sufficiently straight or strong to drive the vehicle if it is ever floated. The propeller is a 
replacement cast by myself and has several flaws. It will only be barely balanced statically and 
this combined with the straightened shaft mean it would be dangerous to use in the manner 
designed. The original for the casting was a genuine Valentine DD propeller from Studland but 
no allowance was made for shrinkage and so it is slightly smaller than the original. The hydraulic 
lift and steering mechanisms are original but the end of one shaft has been reduced in diameter to 
obscure severe rusting. It is intended to add a hand lifting facility to the free end of the lifting  
mechanism, using the hand tiller so that the lift and steer mechanism can be demonstrated by one 
person. This is NOT an original system.<br /></p>

<p class="restore"><b><u>Frame and screen</u></b><br /><br />
To determine the pipe size, a number of factors were used: 1/ Scaling up the parts list. 2/ Careful 
measurement of rust layers in a piece of tubing recovered from Studland. 3/ The likely hood that a 
standard (for the 1940's) tubing section would have been used. 4/ That for a given weight of 
metal, the larger the pipe and the thinner the section (within reason) the more rigid the structure.  
5/ The diameter of the brass air tube clamps, making allowances for the thickness of the rubber 
tubing. All of these considerations led to the same conclusion that it was 2-inch nominal thin wall 
tubing. The frame tubing is 60.8mm-old mild steel welded seam pipe with a nominal wall 
thickness of 3.9mm. This is an almost exact metric equivalent of what the original pipe was, 2- 
inch nominal bore water pipe and it was bent in old 2-inch dies. Barnshaw Benders made the 
"corner" bends to a radius obtained from the parts list, scaled up with the known trackguard 
width. The remainders of the bends were bent with a hand operated hydraulic bender to fit the 
trackguard edge and to fit with each other. The only reference was photographic and more 
attention was paid to making them fit rather than trying to be exact replicas although no errors are  
known about at this stage. The rubber tube to frame clamps are a mixture of originals from 
Studland Bay and replacements cast from originals. The ones for the bent sections of the frame 
show that the clamps and tubes are fitted to the outside of the frame and not inside as with the 
Sherman DD. The brackets on the frame for the lower screen struts are flame cut blanks scaled up 
from the parts list, using the one genuine lower link to obtain the drawings true scale. The upper 
bracket is taken from the same drawing, but is incorrect in that it is for a Mark VDD. No details 
of the Mark IXDD parts are known but the part numbers are different so they cannot be identical. 
The lower screen struts are copies from the original lower link found in the hull and an adjustable
link recovered from Studland. The fork ends are from the parts list. The adjustable upper link is 
copied from one recovered from Studland but it is not known if this is a front or rear piece. It was 
hoped that this would become evident when trying to raise the front and the back of the frame to 
the correct respective heights. In fact it became clear that it was snapped off short so was no help 
in determining original length which was ascertained by trial and error. The design of the fixed 
link of the upper pair is unknown. The parts list states it is made up from riveted construction and 
it has to work with the ends of other pieces, the design of which is known. There is one extremely 
poor photograph which appears to show a built up flat plate assembly and the parts are described 
in a similar manner to the ones on the lifting mechanism links that are drawn so some sort of 
riveted flat plate assembly is considered probable. The hand book states that "this drawing (of the 
screen props) relates to the Mark V. The ones fitted to the Mark 1X are similar in principle but 
differ in detail construction, in particular the joints are offset". Nothing can be gleaned from this. 
The design chosen fits the above criteria (Except can not really be considered as offset) but 
needed to be exact size before being flame cut as no adjustment was possible in assembly. In the 
event of further information coming to light or original parts being recovered from Studland then 
they can be corrected and replaced in the future.<br /></p>

<p class="restore"><b><u>Navigation equipment</u></b><br /><br />
The drivers compass bracket and the P8 compass were recovered from Studland and the compass 
guard show deformation probably sustained when the driver was exiting (or attempting to exit) 
the vehicle as it sank. This deformation will be retained. The rear compass mounting is the correct 
part but actually removed from a Cruiser hulk on Salisbury Plain. The fitting between this 
mounting and the rear rhs trackguard is completely unknown except for one poor photograph of 
Mark V's and IX's on a hard at Gosport so will have to be fabricated from scratch.
